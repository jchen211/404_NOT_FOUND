How it works
Once a user has logged in or registered their account, they will have the option to list their studio space or book listings.

To list a studio, the user would simply fill out a form and provide their Studio type, address, a detailed description of their studio including the amenities and equipment. 

To book a studio, the user would fill out the search form indicating the type of studio and location that they would like to book. Once the search has been initiated,  the results will append to the bottom half of the page, allowing the user to search through and reserve listings.
